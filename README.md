Code description
- CLEAN_FRAP_extraction_and_analysis_2025_10_21: to process raw confocal microscopy (Zeiss .czi format) timelapse images to infer GFP diffusivity.
- CLEAN_FCS_extraction_and_analysis_2025_10_21: to process autocorrelation curves obtained from raw FCS data by another software (we used Symphotime64), to infer GFP inverse residence time in effective FCS volume.
- CLEAN_SEGM_extraction_and_analysis_2025_10_21: to process raw confocal microscopy (Zeiss .czi format) zstack images to infer cell volume and obstacle fractions in user defined cytoplasmic regions. Require an intermediate manual processing using a basic image analysis software such as paint.
